# Financial News Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

This repository provides a robust pipeline for analyzing financial news data and exploring correlations between news sentiment and stock market movements. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, and time series analysis to uncover insights from financial news datasets.

---

## Features

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyze distribution and trends in news headlines.
- Investigate publisher contributions and publication frequency.

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis**
- Utilizes `TextBlob` for sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral).
- Extracts sentiment polarity for each headline.
- Provides visualizations of sentiment distributions.

### 3. **Time Series Analysis**
- Analyzes trends in publication frequency and sentiment over time.
- Identifies patterns in publication dates and times for actionable insights.

### 4. **Git Integration**
- Structured for collaboration and CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions.
