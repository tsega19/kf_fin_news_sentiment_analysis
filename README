Financial News Analysis Pipeline
Overview
This repository contains a pipeline for analyzing financial news data to explore correlations between news sentiment and stock market movements. The analysis leverages exploratory data analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, and time series analysis to extract insights from a financial news dataset.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the distribution and trends in news headlines.
Investigate publisher contributions and publication frequency.
Sentiment Analysis:
Uses Hugging Face's transformers pipeline for sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral).
Provides visualizations of sentiment distributions.
Time Series Analysis:
Analyze trends in publication frequency over time.
Git Integration:
The project is structured to facilitate collaboration and CI/CD workflows.
